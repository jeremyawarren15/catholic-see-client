## Purpose

This project is a continuation of the ParishManager project, under a new name. ParishManager was never intended to be the real name for this project, but the name wasn't as important as what it could do.

The main purpose of this app is to increase the need for adoration in our parishes. To increase the amount of hours that people spend in front of Jesus. There are other features that I have plans to add, but right now I am focusing on adoration specifically.

## What problem does this solve

Currently there are few solutions that are specifically designed for managing hours of adoration. There may be some that I haven't found, but the one solution I did find, was overly complicated and outdated looking. People only care about a few core features and they shouldn't need to be educated to use the app they are using. Someone should be able to basically intuit that "if there's an hour and I press this button I am responsible for that hour now".

This also helps church administration because there are still too many parishes managing hours through paper and pen or spreadsheets. There's also the problem of asking for substitutions. Gone are the days of finding an old sub request email and copy/pasting hundreds of emails only to have someone hijack your email thread. People who are interested in getting sub request emails will get them and then you come to the app to pick them up. No confusion.
